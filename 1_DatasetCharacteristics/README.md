# Dataset Characteristics

- **I have data for the economic structural shift for whole German and for Schleswig-Holstein for the years 1882, 1895, 1907, 1925, 1933 and 1939. I have data for several cohorts (generations) from the censuses.** 

- **I need data for each birth year in order to meaningfully identify the changes. I used TensorFlow for the interpolation of the missing data. I used 'imputation of missing values.ipynb' for this.**

- **And I have to calculate the average shift for each birth year between the censuses. I used 'calculate of the average shift.ipynb' for this.**

- **I made a second attempt for the data analysis with the aggregated data ('exploratory_data_analysis - part two.ipynb').**

- **The share of the primary sector shows a much wider range across generations than the other two sectors.**

- **There are no biases.**

- **There is a positive correlation between age and share of the prinary sector: older cohorts (i.e., earlier birth years) tend to have a higher share in the primary sector (agriculture).**
