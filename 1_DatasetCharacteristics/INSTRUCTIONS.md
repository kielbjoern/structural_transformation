# Dataset Characteristics

## Overview

In this milestone, you are required to explore and analyze the dataset you are using for your project. Understanding your dataset is a critical component of any machine learning project.  
Utilize statistical graphics, plots, and information tables to summarize the dataset's main characteristics.

## Guidelines

Provide information on the following issues:

- **I have data for the economic structural shift for whole German and for Schleswig-Holstein for the years 1882, 1895, 1907, 1925, 1933 and 1939. I have data for several cohorts (generations) from the censusses.** 

- **I need data for each birth year in order to meaningfully identify the changes. I will use TensorFlow for the interpolation of the missing data.**

- **The share of the primary sector shows a much wider range across generations than the other two sectors.**

- **There are no Biases.**

- **There is a positive correlation between age and share of the prinary sector: older cohorts (i.e., earlier birth years) tend to have a higher share in the primary sector (agriculture).**

Follow the instructions provided in brackets in the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) in this folder.

Complete the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) to conduct your analysis of the dataset characteristics.
