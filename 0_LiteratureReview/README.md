# Literature Review

No Approaches before this project, but a long-standing engagement with the topic of economic transformation in Germany and in other countries.

**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: [TensorFlow versus H20:  Predicting the SP500]

  - https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/proceedings/2019/data/assets/pdf/1199535.pdf
  - **Objective**: The objective of the study was to compare TensorFlow/Keras in Python and H2O in R for predicting the SP500 index using machine learning on economic time series data. It was important for me to see, that TensorFlow was used as tool in the social science research.
  - **Methods**: The study used historical monthly economic indicators from 1992â€“2018 to train neural networks in TensorFlow and H2O with varying architectures.
  - **Outcomes**: TensorFlow/Keras achieved the best predictive performance with a lowest RMSE. The study presents an effective neural network design for applications in social science.
  - **Relation to the Project**: A good and motivating starting point for designing my own neural network.

- **Source 2**: [Transfer learning for predicting of gross domestic product growth based on remittance inflows using RNN-LSTM hybrid model: a case study of The Gambia]

  - **Objective**: The objective of the study was to predict GDP growth in The Gambia (Africa) with AI. 
  - **Methods**: The study used remittance inflows and used a recurrent neural network with TensorFlow.
  - **Outcomes**: The model made a great job in forecasting GDP growth based on remittances.
  - **Relation to the Project**: The approach is new and interesting (for me), but maybe a bit too complicated.

- **Source 3**: [CAREER: Transfer Learning for Economic Prediction of Labor Data]

  - **Objective**: The aim of the study was to enable more accurate economic predictions of career trajectories and wages. To achieve this, large-scale resume data was combined with small longitudinal survey datasets.
  - **Methods**: A transformer-based model called CAREER was developed. It was first pretrained on 24 million online resumes and then fine-tuned on previously collected survey data.
  - **Outcomes**: CAREER achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional econometric models.
  - **Relation to the Project**: In my project, I am attempting something similar. I will review the supplementary materials provided for CAREER and evaluate which elements can be adapted for my own work.
