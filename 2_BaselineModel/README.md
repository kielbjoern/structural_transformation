# Baseline Model

- **I choose a simple neural network model. This should be the best for my numeric data.**

- **The goal is to examine the structural change. It is assumed that this depends on the distribution of the sectors and on the age of the people. Since the sector values sum up to 100%, only two of them are needed; therefore, the third sector is deleted.**

- **For Evaluation I used MSE Loss and Mean Absolute Error.**
